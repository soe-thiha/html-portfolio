<P>Eventhough some critizie its familiar and predictable storyline, I found the movie inspiring and heartwarming. It tells the true story of a young woman
who overcomes societal expectations to pursue her passion for sailing. Critics describe the film as a rousing, emotional sports biopic with an inspiring underdog story.
