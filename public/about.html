<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a motivated and self-driven emerging Data Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer with a strong technical foundation in Mechatronics Engineering
  from the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), solid programming experience in Python, and a growing skill set in data engineering tools an
  web development. After moving to Canada, I continued to advance my technical skills through self-study, hands-on projects, and professional
  development courses in Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, SQL, and cloud technologies.</p>

<p>I am currently building end-to-end data engineering and machine learning projects, focusing on data pipelines, ETL workflows, APIs, and real-time data
  processing. I also have ongoing training in web development, Java, and AI engineering to expand my ability to build scalable applications.</p>

<p>With a combination of engineering problem-solving, software development skills, and a long-term goal to specialize in AI and data systems,
   I aim to contribute to innovative teams in Canada as a Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, or AI Engineer. I am passionate about continuous
    learning, creating practical solutions, and building a strong technical portfolio that reflects my growth.</p>
